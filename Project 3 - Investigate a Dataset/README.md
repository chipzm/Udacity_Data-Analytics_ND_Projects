# Project 3 - Investigate a Dataset 
We are doing an exploratory analysis on a given dataset.
The dataset for this project contains more than 10,000 records of movies including their budget, revenue, cast, directors, genres, release year etc. Even though many different analysis can be made with this data, I personally chose to go into detail regarding the different genres and their popularity through the years and the 1 or 2 factors that affect the popularity of the movie.
